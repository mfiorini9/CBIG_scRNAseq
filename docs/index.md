# CBIG Single-cell/spatial RNA seq processing documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to our standardized pipelines for preprocessing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data prior to upload to the C-BIG repository. It is intended for original investigators who wish to contribute their data to C-BIG and want to understand how their data is processed beforehand, as well as for system administrators responsible for executing the pipelines prior to upload.

The following pipelines are currently supported and covered in this documentation: <br />

- Single-cell RNA sequencing (10X genomics)
- Spatial RNA sequencing (Visium HD)

These pipelines are actively maintained and undergo ongoing optimization at the Montreal Neurological Institute. We welcome feedback and contributions as part of our collaborative data-sharing efforts. **Additional pipelines for other sequencing platforms will be added soon.**

If you are interested in making your single-cell or spatial RNAseq data available through the C-BIG repository, please contact [Michael Fiorini](mailto:michael.fiorini@mail.mcgill.ca).
